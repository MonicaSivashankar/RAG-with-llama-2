Specifically, the threshold was set to activate only if the seasonal rainfall was forecasted to be at least a 1 in 4-year return period level deficit at any lead time.

In other words, the 1 in 4-year return period represents the minimum level of drought-related impacts that the mechanism is designed to respond to.

By setting the trigger mechanism to activate every 4 years, the framework takes into account the longer-term nature of drought impacts in the region and allows for the preparation and anticipation of these impacts over a longer period of time. This approach is intended to help reduce the vulnerability of communities in the CADC region to drought-related impacts and improve their resilience to these impacts over the long term.

Furthermore, the use of a 4-year return period represents a compromise between the need to anticipate and prepare for drought-related impacts and the need to avoid unnecessary activation of the mechanism.
