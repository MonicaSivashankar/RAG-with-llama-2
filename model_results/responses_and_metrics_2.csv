The primary goal of the INFORM Risk Index is to provide a comprehensive and standardized framework for assessing the potential impact of natural hazards on a population, taking into account the changing capacity and vulnerability of the population due to environmental and social changes. By providing a quantitative measure of risk, the INFORM Risk Index aims to help policymakers, researchers, and other stakeholders make more informed decisions about how to manage and mitigate the impact of natural hazards on a population.

In particular, the INFORM Risk Index seeks to address the challenge of mapping the technopolitics of mapping disasters by examining the technical and political motivations behind the creation of the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team's map of the Salam area. The INFORM Risk Index aims to provide a more nuanced understanding of the complex factors that influence the mapping of disasters and the impact of these maps on the population.

1. Morality and ethics: Classical Greek philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle have had a profound impact on English literature, providing rich themes and materials for subsequent literary works. Their thoughts on morality, ethics, and political philosophy have deeply infused English literature with contemplations on ethical and moral issues.
2. Human life and society: Socrates' exploration of human life and his deep reflections on moral ethics have been integrated into English literature. Plato’s concept of an ideal state and metaphysical thought have ignited literary dialogues and conflicts between idealism and realism in English literature.

The themes of classical Greek philosophy, particularly those explored by Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, have had a profound impact on English literature. Some of the themes commonly explored in English literature influenced by classical Greek philosophy include:

1. Morality and Ethics: Classical Greek philosophy emphasized the importance of ethics and morality in human life. English literature reflects this emphasis through themes such as the conflict between moral duty and personal desire, the nature of justice and fairness, and the importance of living a virtuous life. Many works of English literature, such as Shakespeare's Hamlet, explore these themes through the lens of human nature and psychology.
2. Human Nature and Psychology: Classical Greek philosophy explored the nature of human beings, including their emotions, desires, and rationality. English literature often explores these themes through characters and their psychological motivations, such as the struggle for self-awareness and understanding in works like Shakespeare's Hamlet.
